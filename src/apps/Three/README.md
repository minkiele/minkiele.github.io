# Three

This is a WebGL scene I made by combining some examples I found in
[ThreeJS docs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)
and in [ThreeJS sources](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r148).
Then I tried to apply [Spherical Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system)
to move the camera applied to the scene. I added some solids to not lose the orientation.
**Red** represents **X** axis, **Green** the **Y** axis and **Blue** the **Z** axis. Keeping up with
the old OpenGL tradition sometimes I had to flip signs to make things go my way.

To navigate the example you can click and drag the scene to rotate it
and scroll the mousewheel to zoom in and out.

To navigate the example with keyboard you can use **WSAD** to move around the scene
and **+ and -** to zoom in and out.

After expanding the example I phased out the initial examples I built.
