# Three

Sample renderings made with [three.js](https://threejs.org/). First one is made taking something from the other examples and playing a little bit.
I'll be working on this exploring new the documentation.

Second one comes from [the docs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and third one comes from [the source](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r148).
