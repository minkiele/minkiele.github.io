# Snake

One of my forgotten dreams was to build a clone of Snake that could run on a browser,
the one that was included in the Nokia 3210 cellphone.
Yes, **the** [Nokia 3210](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3210),
the dad of all cool phones. In 1999 it had interchangeable covers,
background logos and custom ringtones you sent yourself via SMS, and games.
The game I liked the most was Snake, at the time we passed hours in buses
asking to borrow our friend's phones just to try and fill the screen with that Snake,
mostly because we didn't have cellphones.

## The process
So I started by stating facts, I found some pictures of Snake being played on the 3210,
and I wrote them down. 

## Instructions

To play press the *arrows*, *WSAD*, spacebar or
enter. To pause the game press spacebar or enter, to resume it press
the *arrows*, *WSAD*, spacebar or enter. When game is over you can reset
it by pressing the Reset button or spacebar or enter.
