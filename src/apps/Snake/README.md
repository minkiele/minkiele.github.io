# Snake

One of my forgotten dreams was to build a clone of Snake that could run on a browser,
the one that was included in the Nokia 3210 cellphone.
Yes, **the** [Nokia 3210](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3210),
the dad of all cool phones. In 1999 it had interchangeable covers,
background logos and custom ringtones you sent yourself via SMS, and games.
The game I liked the most was Snake, at the time we passed hours in buses
asking to borrow our friend's phones just to try and fill the screen with that Snake,
mostly because we didn't have cellphones.

## The process

So I started by stating facts: I found some pictures of Snake being played on the 3210,
and I wrote them down. Measuring the picture I found out that the board is 24x17. Then
I remembered that the snake got longer only when the eaten fruit reached its tail.
I cannot recall how it started so I put the snake on the most probable location.

Through some iterations I then simplified the calculations. For this iteration I devised
a way in which we have to draw only the snake and apple squares. I think it needs some sorting
before printing it

## Instructions
