      <p>
        The Dragon fractal is a fractal obtained by (ideally) folding a piece of
        paper in half in the same direction for a number of times. The figure is
        obtained by unfolding every fold at 90Â°. I was obsessed with this
        picture since I saw it at the beginning of the chapters in Jurassic
        Park. Twenty years later I searched for it in the Internet and found the
        explanation.

          This will generate a dragon fractal with the specified iterations
          (after 15 iterations will start to considerably slow down).
