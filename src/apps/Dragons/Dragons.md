# The Dragon Fractal

The [Dragon fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve)
is a fractal obtained by (ideally) folding a piece of
paper in half in the same direction for a number of times. The figure is
obtained by unfolding every fold at 90Â°. I was obsessed with this
picture since I saw it at the beginning of the chapters in Jurassic
Park. Twenty years later I searched for it in the Internet and found the
explanation.
