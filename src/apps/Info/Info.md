## About the author

Hi there, my name is Michele, I'm 38.
I was born and raised in Italy, in a small town nearby Venice lagoon and I
still live there.

### That article that never got published

Some years ago I wrote a little profile article about myself, just as I
switched jobs, and it was going to be published in my current company's
journal as a piece about getting to know some new employees. I wrote that
as the ones you see on book jackets; I must say that's one of the funniest
and most ridiculous things I've ever written.

Well, it never got published, and my life changed in the last years, as I
think it happened for everybody, so it isn't very accurate; and I'd like to
protect, for what is worth, whatever little is left of my privacy.

## Other little projects

Yes, I have another little project published in Github:
[EnigmaUI](https://minkiele.github.io/EnigmaUI). This is a
javascript implementation of the Enigma Machine
