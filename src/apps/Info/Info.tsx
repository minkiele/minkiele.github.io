    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there, my name is Michele, I'm 38 <abbr title="years old">y.o.</abbr>.
      I was born and raised in Italy, in a small town nearby Venice lagoon and I
      still live there.

    <h3>That article that never got published</h3>
    <p>
      Some years ago I wrote a little profile article about myself, just as I
      switched jobs, and it was going to be published in my current company's
      journal as a piece about getting to know some new employees. I wrote that
      as the ones you see on book jackets; I must say that's one of the funniest
      and most ridiculous things I've ever written.
      <br />
      Well, it never got published, and my life changed in the last years, as I
      think it happened for everybody, so it isn't accurate; and I'd like to
      protect, for what is worth, whatever little is left of my privacy.
    </p>

      For the most part this is a <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>

    <h2>Other little projects</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, I have another little project published in Github:{" "}
      <a href="https://minkiele.github.io/EnigmaUI">EnigmaUI</a>. This is a
      javascript implementation of the Enigma Machine
