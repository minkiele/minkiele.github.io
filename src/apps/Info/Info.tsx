    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there, my name is Michele, I'm 38 <abbr title="years old">y.o.</abbr>.
      I was born and raised in Italy, in a small town nearby Venice lagoon and I
      still live there.

    <h3>That article that never got published</h3>
    <p>
      Some years ago I wrote a little profile article about myself, just as I switched jobs,
      and it was going to be published in my current company's journal as a piece about getting
      to know some new employees. I wrote that as the ones you see on book jackets;
      I must say that's one of the funniest and most ridiculous things I've ever written.<br />
      Well, it never got published, and my life changed in the last years, as I think
      it happened for everybody, so it isn't accurate; and I'd like to protect, for what
      is worth, whatever little is left of my privacy.
