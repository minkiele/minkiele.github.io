# Jump Matrix

## The game

This is a game I did learn in middle school, you have a 5x5 square, and you must fill the
square with the numbers from 1 to 25. You can start wherever you want but you can move from cell
to cell following these rules: moving horizontally or vertically you must jump 2 cells,
moving diagonally you must jump 1 cell. It seems hard but you average 19 moves before
ending.
