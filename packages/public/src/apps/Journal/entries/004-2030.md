# Journal Entry
## 2030

It's the year 2030
And I find myself that I'm almost 60
My goatee is grey and I've ran out of hair
And Ambra is the first woman president

The sky is almost hidden
we go out with the gas mask on
on the bus there's business class
and to enter a church, you'll need a pass.

everybody talk only through the internet
and the parliament has its office in Hammammet
there are shootings in the underground metro
between north and south there is a border
but everybody dresses in Dolce & Gabbana.

But my mind wanders back, quickly runs,
to before the 2000s, lotsa time ago
when we could still make it,
but now no, so I

I miss a lot the '90s
when the world was the ark and we were Noah
it was hard, but possible,
we did not know where or how but we still knew why.

There were the ones with good will,
there were those who were together,
there were those who loved despite the evil
there was the music, I remember,
the music the music, there was the music

We're in the year 2030
they control TV and the radio
there's an audio censorship committee
they evaluate and decide what yes and what no

They give us harmless music, after the testing
they give us Sanremo, still presented by Baudo
with the flowers the stage is spectacular
this year won Bossi, who started to sing again!

It's the year 2030
Italy sold the Colosseum to France, Venice sinks
2030 and one day after the other blows up a bomb
2030 and we've ran out of air

But we've got plenty of hate,
first they divided north and south
and then city by city, and think
everybody is closed inside their room
intolerance dances there's no hope I

I miss a lot the '90s
when the world was the ark and we were Noah
it was hard, but possible,
we did not know where or how but we still knew why.

There were the ones with good will,
there were those who were together,
there were those who loved despite the evil
there was the music, I remember,
the music the music, there was the music

This is the year 2030
the ones who think are a minority
but it's not important,
there's no need anymore

2030, indifference is a virtue
cybernazis have a show on TV
preachers beat up the homeless in the name of Jesus

The national anthem sounds like a funeral hymn
virtual sex is safer because there is
a virus that you get through sweat
and in 90 hours you're dead
HIV by comparison seems the sniffles

it's a war experiment gone rogue
and the outcome it's that nobody makes love anymore
and I'm an outlaw because I talk about this
because I wander to when we could have stopped this
now it's too late, for a pirate poet that tells is memories as

I miss a lot the '90s
when the world was the ark and we were Noah
it was hard, but possible,
we did not know where or how but we still knew why.

There were the ones with good will,
there were those who were together,
there were those who loved despite the evil
there was the music, I remember,
the music the music, there was the music
