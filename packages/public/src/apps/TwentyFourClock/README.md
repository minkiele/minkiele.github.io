# 24 Clock

The following takes place between 3pm and 5pm on a lazy summer saturday afternoon.
There are 3 different controllers that light up the digits:

1. The full controller, used to control the hour, minute and second units
2. The simple controller, used only to show digits from 0 to 5 on the tens of minutes and seconds
3. The hour controller, used only to show digits from 0 to 2 on the tens of hours

Obviously I'm not an electronic engineer and with a little more thought I could simplify
the logic, because the full controller has more logic gates than I like.
