This was inspired by [Polygen](http://polygen.org/), I wanted to create
a suite of functions that could help you write a Polygen-like generative grammar.
The verbs are very limited but they do most of the work you need. The challenge
for me here was to pick out an element from a weighted collection. The
pseudo-random generator does not work very well here, too many terms are
repeated but it seems ok.
