# Circles

This is a full clock that renders all the date and time parameters that can be limited into a range.
Circles are filled in relation to the area, not the radius, and that's a curious effect because you don't expect
how the same area occupied at the start of a period is free at the end of said period. Also date and time colors
are statically interpolated and are set for every hour and every day.
