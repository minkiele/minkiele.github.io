## About the author

Hi there, my name is Michele, I'm 38.
I was born and raised in Italy, in a small town nearby Venice lagoon and I
still live there.

### That article that never got published

Some years ago I wrote a little profile article about myself, just as I
switched jobs, and it was going to be published in my current company's
journal as a piece about getting to know some new employees. I wrote that
as the ones you see on book jackets; I must say that's one of the funniest
and most ridiculous things I've ever written.

Well, it never got published, and my life changed in the last years, as I
think it happened for everybody, so it isn't very accurate; and I'd like to
protect, for what is worth, whatever little is left of my privacy.

## About _this_ little project

I rounded up a lot of little projects I wrote on my personal and work laptop.
Some of those already had a UI, to some others I built one just for this purpose.
Then I started styling the website, to give it a cool nerdy retro look. After
that I added support for dark theme. After that I started to optimize and tweak
the build, trying to learn new things, mostly on Webpack.

This you're seeing now is a "port" of the main project made in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
Code is mostly the same, though I had to make some changes to accomodate
Next.js requirements. Some of these changes are actually good and will be applied
back into the original [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) environment
I first used to make this portfolio. Also, I wrote this paragraph just to break
Github Pages cache (and I'm realizing now that Next.js uses a unique path to files
which would break cache anyways).

### About dark mode

Now _dark_ mode is the default when you visit for the first time the website.
Since it uses Next.js Static Site Generation and the default theme is _light_
every time you reload the website light theme will flash briefly before setting
to dark mode. Unfortunately that's something I cannot remove without causing the
reverse problem. Trying to waste a little bit less energy.

## About other little projects

Yes, I have another little project published in Github:
[EnigmaUI](https://minkiele.github.io/EnigmaUI). This is a
javascript implementation of the Enigma Machine.
