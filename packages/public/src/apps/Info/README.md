## About the author

Hi there, my name is Michele, I was born and raised in Italy,
in a small town nearby Venice lagoon and I still live there;
I'm scared shitless of becoming forty.

## About this little project

This project started around the end of '22 because I had _plenty_ of free time,
so I rounded up a lot of little projects I wrote on my personal and work laptop
along the years, some of those already had a UI, to some others I built one
just for this purpose.
Then I started styling the website, to give it a cool nerdy retro look. After
that I added support for dark theme. After that I started to optimize and tweak
the build to learn something new every time, and I still am. You will find sources
for the applications in [GitHub](https://github.com/minkiele/minkiele.github.io).

### About dark mode

Now _dark_ mode is the default when you visit for the first time the website.
The website was built using the _light_ theme, so for technical reasons
every time you reload the website light theme will flash briefly before setting
to dark mode. Unfortunately that's something I cannot remove without causing the
reverse problem. Trying to waste a little bit less energy.

## About other little projects

Yes, I have another little project published in Github:
[EnigmaUI](https://minkiele.github.io/EnigmaUI). This is a
javascript implementation of the Enigma Machine.

## What about love?

I almost forgot... built with ❤️ and lots of free time near Venice.
