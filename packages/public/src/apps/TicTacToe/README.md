# Tic Tac Toe

Implementation of Tic Tac Toe, 1 vs 1 and 1 vs PC.
Player 1 plays always with ❌ while Player 2 and PC play with ⭕.

There's a rudimentary algorithm to try and determine the next move by the PC.
Also the waiting between moves is just aesthetic.

There's also a a little support for accessibility, with aria labels
and announcements of PC plays.
