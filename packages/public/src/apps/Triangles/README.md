# Tartaglia's triangle

Tartaglia's triangle main feature is showing the binomial coefficients for the expression
(a + b)^n where n is the (n + 1)th row of the triangle. If n was 3 then the 4th row would
go 1-3-3-1 so you would have (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2*b + 3a*b^2 + b^3. If n was 4 then you
would have (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3*b + 6a^2*b^2 + 4a*b^3 + b^4; and the list goes on.

Tartaglia's triangle also shows a graphic representation of the Fibonacci sequence,
but you have to squint your eyes, skew the device and look to the diagonals.
