# Cruciverba

An implementation of the crosswords schema with automatic calculation of
definitions number.

## Instructions
- Click (or tap) on cells to activate the input. After providing a valid input
you're automatically moved to the next horizontal cell.
- By double clicking a cell or pressing *spacebar* you toggle the block.
On mobile devices it can be hard to toggle the block, you may have to focus
on an input and then *very rapidly* double tap the cell.

You should try the templates for *Incroci Obbligati*, *Ricerca di Parole Crociate*
and *Cornici Concentriche* modes, they seriously helped me to solve some schemes
that were hoplessly *DOOOOMED* on paper. Inspired by that I added
some other recurring schemes in the *Settimana Enigmistica*.
