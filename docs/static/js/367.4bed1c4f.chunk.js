I wrote that\nas the ones you see on book jackets; I must say that's one of the funniest\nand most ridiculous things I've ever written.\n\nWell, it never got published, and my life changed in the last years, as I\nthink it happened for everybody, so it isn't very accurate; and I'd like to\nprotect, for what is worth, whatever little is left of my privacy.\n\n## Other little projects\n\nYes, I have another little project published in Github:\n[EnigmaUI](https://minkiele.github.io/EnigmaUI). This is a\njavascript implementation of the Enigma Machine\n"})})}},1611:function(e,n,t){t.d(n,{Z:function(){return r}});var i=t(7363),a=t(7973),o=t(6417),r=(0,i.memo)((function(e){var n=e.children;return(0,o.jsx)(a.D,{components:{h1:function(){return(0,i.createElement)(i.Fragment)}},children:n})}))}}]);
